<p>According to the W3C specifications:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A string cannot directly contain a newline. To include a newline in a string, use an escape representing the line feed character in ISO-10646
  (U+000A), such as "\A" or "\00000a".</p>
  <p>[…​]</p>
  <p>It is possible to break strings over several lines, for aesthetic or other reasons, but in such a case the newline itself has to be escaped with
  a backslash (\).</p>
