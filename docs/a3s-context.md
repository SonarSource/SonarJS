# SonarJS A3S context contract

SonarJS owns the context of kind `javascript`. Shared context information is carried in the
collector's JSON metadata, not in a file attachment:

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "baseDir": "C:/ci/project",
    "sources": ["src"],
    "disableTypeChecking": false
  }
}
```

Java saves its complete raw `ProjectConfiguration` request using the standard Protobuf JSON
serializer. The request schema is the single source of truth for recorded fields; recording has
no setting whitelist or Node sanitization. `baseDir` lives only inside that configuration.
Explicit booleans, omitted versus empty wrapped lists, repeated fields and numeric values retain
their protocol semantics (64-bit integers use JSON strings).

WebSensor creates this JSON before sending the analysis request and publishes it through
`A3SContextCollector` after the two attachments are produced. Node returns no collector metadata.
SQAA forwards the stored string
using `sonar.javascript.internal.contextMetadata`. WebSensor validates the metadata structure and
project root, reconstructs logical request paths, and forwards the same JSON in
`filesystem_cache.context_metadata`. Node restores the captured settings, rebasing project-owned
absolute paths together when replay crosses operating systems. Paths remain Unix-normalized.

Node's replayable-field list controls restoration only, not recording. It restores saved analysis
settings before invoking the same normalization used during CI, including resetting omitted
settings rather than inheriting SQAA defaults. Runtime-only flags (`sonarlint`, `skipAst`,
`canAccessFileSystem`, incremental events/mode) and submitted contents/active rules belong to the
current request. Recorded `tsConfigPaths` remain available in raw metadata, but recorded program
selection determines which program is restored. Java and SQAA do not duplicate the restore list.

There are still exactly two attachments:

- `filesystem-cache`: observed project filesystem inputs.
- `analysis-metadata`: program selection only (configured/orphan programs, compiler options,
  file mappings and explicit no-program outcomes). The item ID is retained, although shared
  analysis metadata now lives in JSON.

Only Node decodes these gzip/Protobuf attachments. Java and SQAA inspect their existence and size
but never decompress or parse them. Java no longer generates classes from the snapshot schema.
The removed configuration, derived scope and project-root Protobuf fields are reserved.

SQAA enforces the analyzer-version compatibility of CI contexts; there is no second format-version
check in SonarJS. Missing or old `{}` collector metadata uses the established logged no-context
fallback. Malformed metadata, incomplete attachments, corrupt snapshots or invalid paths must not
masquerade as successful restoration. The real Java/Node recording-replay test checks this contract, while
SQAA's adapter test verifies lossless forwarding without interpreting either attachment.

Project reproducibility remains bounded by `baseDir`. External CI dependencies and runtime files
are not captured as portable project inputs. The filesystem/program-selection pairing and
authoritative submitted contents are unchanged.
