# Version overrides: pmg auto-detects which deps are used, but these two need
# non-default versions. `builtin-modules` is pinned to 3.3.0 (last CJS-compatible
# release) because the plugin is compiled to CommonJS; the root package.json has
# 5.0.0 (ESM-only) for the bridge. `typescript` is loosened to >=5 so consumers
# aren't forced onto the exact version used to build.
