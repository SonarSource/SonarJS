/**
 * An input rule configuration for linting
 *
 * @param key an ESLint rule key that maps a SonarQube rule identifier (SXXX) to the rule implementation
 * @param configurations an ESLint rule configuration provided from the anaylzer if the rule behaviour is customizable
 * @param fileTypeTargets a list of file type targets to filter issues in case the rule applies to main files, test files, or both
 *
 * The configuration of a rule is used to uniquely identify a rule, customize its behaviour,
 * and define what type(s) of file it should apply to during linting.
 *
 * An ESLint rule configuration can theoretically be a plain JavaScript object or a string. However, given the
 * nature of SonarQube's rule properties, it is currently used in the form of a string.
