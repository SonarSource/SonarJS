<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Extra semicolons are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It was meant to be replaced by one more property declaration, but this was forgotten. </li>
  <li> There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>. </li>
</ul>
