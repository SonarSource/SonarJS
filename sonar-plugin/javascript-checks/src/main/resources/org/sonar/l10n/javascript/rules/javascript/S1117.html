<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Overriding or shadowing a variable declared in an outer scope can strongly impact the readability, and therefore the maintainability, of a piece of
code. Further, it could lead maintainers to introduce bugs because they think they’re using one variable but are really using another.</p>
