<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>ECMAScript 2015 added the ability to use template literals instead of concatenation. Since their use is clearer and more concise, they are
preferred in environments that support ECMAScript 2015.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log("hello " + name);  // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`hello ${name}`);
}
</pre>
