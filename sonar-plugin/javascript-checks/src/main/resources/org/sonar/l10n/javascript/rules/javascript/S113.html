<p>This rule is deprecated, and will eventually be removed.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Some tools work better when files end with a newline.</p>
<p>This rule simply generates an issue if it is missing.</p>
<p>For example, a Git diff looks like this if the empty line is missing at the end of the file:</p>
<pre>
+class Test {
+}
\ No newline at end of file
</pre>
