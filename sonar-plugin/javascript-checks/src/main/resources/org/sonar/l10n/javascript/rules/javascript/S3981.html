<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The size of a collection and the length of an array are always greater than or equal to zero. Testing it doesn’t make sense, since the result is
always <code>true</code>.</p>
<pre>
if (someSet.size &gt;= 0) {...} // Noncompliant always true

const result = someArray.length &gt;= 0;  // Noncompliant always true
</pre>
<p>Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return <code>false</code>.</p>
<pre>
if (someMap.size &lt; 0) {...} // Noncompliant always false
</pre>
<p>Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.</p>
