<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when a comment matches a given regular expression.</p>
<p>For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression&nbsp;<code>.*REVIEW.*</code>&nbsp;to match all comment containing "REVIEW".</p>
