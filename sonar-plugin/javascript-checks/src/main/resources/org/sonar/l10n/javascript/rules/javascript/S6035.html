<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When an alternation contains multiple alternatives that consist of a single character, it can be rewritten as a character class. This should be
preferred because it is more efficient and can even help prevent stack overflows when used inside a repetition (see rule {rule:javascript:S5998}).</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
/a|b|c/; // Noncompliant
