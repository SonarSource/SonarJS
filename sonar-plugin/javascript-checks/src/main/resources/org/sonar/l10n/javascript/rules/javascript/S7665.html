<p>This rule raises an issue when binary files specified in the <code>bin</code> field of <code>package.json</code> would be ignored during npm
publishing.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When you publish a Node.js package with CLI commands, you specify executable files in the <code>bin</code> field of <code>package.json</code>.
However, if these binary files are excluded from publishing (either by not being listed in the <code>files</code> field or by being ignored in
<code>.npmignore</code>), the package installation will fail.</p>
<p>Npm uses the <code>files</code> field and <code>.npmignore</code> to determine which files to include in the published package. If a binary file
referenced in the <code>bin</code> field is not included, users who install your package wonâ€™t be able to use the CLI commands, leading to broken
functionality.</p>
<p>This creates a mismatch between what the package declares it provides (executable commands) and what it actually delivers (missing binary
files).</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>When binary files are missing from the published package, users will encounter errors when trying to use the CLI commands. This can lead to failed
installations, broken CI/CD pipelines, and frustrated users who cannot access the advertised functionality of your package.</p>
<h3>How to fix?</h3>
<p>Include the binary file in the <code>files</code> field of package.json to ensure it gets published.</p>
