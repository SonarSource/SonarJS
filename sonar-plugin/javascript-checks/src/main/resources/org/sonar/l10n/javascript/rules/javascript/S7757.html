<p>This rule raises an issue when properties are assigned to <code>this</code> in a constructor instead of being declared as class fields.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Modern JavaScript supports class field declarations, which provide a cleaner and more readable way to define class properties compared to
constructor assignments.</p>
<p>When properties are assigned in constructors using <code>this.property = value</code>, the code becomes more verbose and harder to read. Class
field declarations offer several advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Better readability</strong>: Property declarations are immediately visible at the class level </li>
  <li> <strong>Reduced boilerplate</strong>: No need for constructor code when only setting default values </li>
  <li> <strong>Consistent syntax</strong>: Aligns with modern JavaScript standards and practices </li>
  <li> <strong>Clearer intent</strong>: Makes it obvious which properties belong to the class </li>
</ul>
<p>Class field declarations also work with both public and private properties (using the <code>#</code> prefix), providing a unified approach to
property definition.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>This issue affects code maintainability and readability. While it doesnâ€™t cause runtime errors, using outdated patterns makes the codebase harder
to understand and maintain. Teams working with modern JavaScript expect to see class field syntax, and constructor-based assignments can appear
outdated or unnecessarily verbose.</p>
<h3>How to fix?</h3>
<p>Move simple property assignments from the constructor to class field declarations. This makes the code more concise and follows modern JavaScript
conventions.</p>
<h4>Non-compliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class Foo {
  constructor() {
    this.foo = 'foo'; // Noncompliant
  }
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
class Foo {
  foo = 'foo';
}
</pre>
