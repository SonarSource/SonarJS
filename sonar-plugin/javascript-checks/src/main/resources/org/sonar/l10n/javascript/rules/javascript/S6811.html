<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>ARIA properties, also known as "aria-* properties", are special attributes used in HTML to enhance the accessibility of web elements. They provide
additional semantics to help assistive technologies, like screen readers, interpret the element.</p>
<p>Roles, on the other hand, define what an element is or does in the context of a web page. Some elements have explicit roles, which are directly
defined by the developer. For example, a div element might be given a role of "button". Other elements have implicit roles, which are inferred based
on the type of the element. For example, an anchor tag &lt;a href="#" /&gt; has an implicit role of "link".</p>
<p>This rule ensures that the ARIA properties used on an element are ones that are supported by the role of that element. For instance, the ARIA
property <code>aria-required</code> is not supported by the role <code>link</code>. Therefore, using <code>aria-required</code> on an anchor tag would
violate this rule.</p>
<h2>How to fix it in JSX</h2>
<p>Check the spelling of the aria-* attributes and verify that they are actually supported by the element role.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
&lt;div role="checkbox" aria-chekd={isChecked}&gt;Unchecked&lt;/div&gt; {/* Noncompliant: aria-chekd is not supported */}
</pre>
<p>To fix the code remove non-compatible attributes or replace them with the correct ones.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
&lt;div role="checkbox" aria-checked={isChecked}&gt;Unchecked&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
