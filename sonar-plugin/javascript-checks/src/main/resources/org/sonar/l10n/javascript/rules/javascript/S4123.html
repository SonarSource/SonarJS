<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They provide a way to handle asynchronous
operations in a more organized and manageable manner. To use <code>await</code>, you need to ensure that you are calling a function or an expression
that returns a promise.</p>
<p>The reason <code>await</code> should only be used on a promise is that it expects the operand to be a promise object. When you use
<code>await</code>, it waits for the promise to be resolved or rejected and then returns the resolved value or throws the rejection reason,
respectively. If the operand of <code>await</code> is not a promise, awaiting it is redundant and might not have been the developer’s intent.</p>
<p>If you try to use <code>await</code> on a non-promise value, such as a regular object or a primitive type, it will not pause the execution of the
function because there is no asynchronous behavior involved. Instead, <code>await</code> will convert the value to a resolved promise, and waits for
it.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
const x = 42;
await x; // Noncompliant: x is a number, not a promise
</pre>
<p>You should only use <code>await</code> on promises because it is designed to handle asynchronous operations and works in conjunction with the
Promise API to provide a clean and intuitive way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
const x = Promise.resolve(42);
await x;
</pre>
