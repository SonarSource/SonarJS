<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Trailing whitespaces bring no information, they may generate noise when comparing different versions of the same file, and they can create bugs
when they appear after a <code>\</code> marking a line continuation. They should be systematically removed.</p>
<p>An automated code formatter allows to completely avoid this family of issues and should be used wherever possible.</p>
<pre>
// The following string will error if there is a whitespace after '\'
var str = "Hello \
World";
</pre>
