<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A collection is a data structure that holds multiple values, such as an array or a map. If a collection is declared and populated, but its values
are never read anywhere in the code, it can be considered unused code. This can be due to some refactoring, copy-pasting, or typing errors.</p>
<p>Unused collections can waste memory usage and slow down the applicationâ€™s performance. Additionally, they can make the code harder to read and
understand, especially for other developers working on the same codebase.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
function getLength(a, b, c) {
  const strings = [];  // Noncompliant: Array is declared and populated but never read
  strings.push(a);
  strings.push(b);
  strings.push(c);

  return a.length + b.length + c.length;
}
</pre>
<p>Remove unused collections so that the application can run faster and more smoothly. The code becomes cleaner and more efficient, making it easier
to read, understand, and maintain.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
function getLength(a, b, c) {
  return a.length + b.length + c.length;
}
