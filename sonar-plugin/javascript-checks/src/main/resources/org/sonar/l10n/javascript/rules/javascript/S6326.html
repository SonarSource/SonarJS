<p>Multiple spaces in a regular expression can make it hard to tell how many spaces should be matched. It’s more readable to use only one space and
then indicate with a quantifier how many spaces are expected.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
const pattern = /Hello,   world!/;

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
const pattern = /Hello, {3}world!/;
