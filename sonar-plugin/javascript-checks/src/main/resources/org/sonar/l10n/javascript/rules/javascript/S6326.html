<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Multiple spaces in a regular expression can make it hard to tell how many spaces should be matched. It’s more readable to use only one space and
then indicate with a quantifier how many spaces are expected.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
const pattern = /Hello,   world!/;
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
const pattern = /Hello, {3}world!/;
</pre>
