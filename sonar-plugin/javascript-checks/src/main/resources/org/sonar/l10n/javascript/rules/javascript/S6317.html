<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the service that defines access to AWS resources. One of the core components of IAM is the policy
which, when attached to an identity or a resource, defines its permissions. Policies granting permission to an Identity (a User, a Group or Role) are
called identity-based policies. They add the ability to an identity to perform a predefined set of actions on a list of resources.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a policy document defining a limited set of permission that grants a user the ability to manage his own access keys.</p>
<pre>
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateAccessKey",
                "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:UpdateAccessKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::245500951992:user/${aws:username}",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "AllowManageOwnAccessKeys"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
<p>Privilege escalation generally happens when an identity policy gives an identity the ability to grant more privileges than the ones it already has.
Here is another example of a policy document that hides a privilege escalation. It allows an identity to generate a new access key for any user from
the account, including users with high privileges.</p>
<pre>
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateAccessKey",
                "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:UpdateAccessKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "AllowManageOwnAccessKeys"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
<p>Although it looks like it grants a limited set of permissions, this policy would, in practice, give the highest privileges to the identity it’s
attached to.</p>
<p>Privilege escalation is a serious issue as it allows a malicious user to easily escalate to a high privilege identity from a low privilege identity
it took control of.</p>
<p>The example above is just one of many permission escalation vectors. Here is the list of vectors that the rule can detect:</p>

<p>The general recommendation to protect against privilege escalation is to restrict the resources to which sensitive permissions are granted. The
first example above is a good demonstration of sensitive permissions being used with a narrow scope of resources and where no privilege escalation is
possible.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>The following policy allows an attacker to update the code of any Lambda function. An attacker can achieve privilege escalation by altering the
code of a Lambda that executes with high privileges.</p>
<pre>
import {aws_iam as iam} from 'aws-cdk-lib'

new iam.PolicyDocument({
    statements: [new iam.PolicyStatement({
        effect: iam.Effect.ALLOW,
        actions: ["lambda:UpdateFunctionCode"],
        resources: ["*"], // Noncompliant
    })],
})
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>Narrow the policy such that only updates to the code of certain Lambda functions are allowed.</p>
<pre>
import {aws_iam as iam} from 'aws-cdk-lib'

new iam.PolicyDocument({
    statements: [new iam.PolicyStatement({
        effect: iam.Effect.ALLOW,
        actions: ["lambda:UpdateFunctionCode"],
        resources: ["arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:my-function:1"], // Noncompliant
    })],
})
</pre>
