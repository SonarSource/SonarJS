<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>There are several reasons to use a group in a regular expression:</p>
<ul>
  <li> to change the precedence (e.g. <code>do(g|or)</code> will match 'dog' and 'door') </li>
  <li> to remember parenthesised part of the match in the case of capturing group </li>
  <li> to improve readability </li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, having an empty group is most probably a mistake. Either it is a leftover after refactoring and should be removed, or the actual
parentheses were intended and were not escaped.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
const dateRegex = /^(?:0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[- /.](?:0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](?:19|20)\d\d(?:)$/; // Noncompliant, useless group at the end
const methodCallRegex = /foo()/;  // Noncompliant, will match only 'foo'
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
const dateRegex = /^(?:0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[- /.](?:0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](?:19|20)\d\d$/;
const methodCallRegex = /foo\(\)/; // OK, matches 'foo()'
</pre>
