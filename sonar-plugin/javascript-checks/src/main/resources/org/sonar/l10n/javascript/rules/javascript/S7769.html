<p>This rule triggers when legacy mathematical expressions are used that can be replaced with modern Math APIs introduced in ES2015.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>ES2015 introduced many new Math methods that provide clearer, more readable alternatives to complex mathematical expressions. Using these modern
APIs offers several benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Improved readability</strong>: Modern Math methods express mathematical intent more clearly. For example, <code>Math.log10(x)</code>
immediately tells you that youâ€™re calculating a base-10 logarithm, while <code>Math.log(x) / Math.LN10</code> requires mathematical knowledge to
understand.</p>
<p><strong>Better performance</strong>: Native Math methods are typically optimized by JavaScript engines and can perform better than equivalent
manual calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced error potential</strong>: Complex mathematical expressions are more prone to mistakes. Using dedicated methods reduces the chance
of calculation errors.</p>
<p><strong>Standardized approach</strong>: Modern Math APIs provide a consistent way to perform common mathematical operations across different
codebases.</p>
<p>The most common cases involve logarithmic calculations and distance calculations using the Pythagorean theorem, where the intent becomes much
clearer with modern APIs.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Using legacy mathematical patterns instead of modern Math APIs reduces code readability and maintainability. Complex expressions are harder to
understand and more error-prone. Performance may also be suboptimal compared to native implementations.</p>
<h3>How to fix?</h3>
<p>Replace Math.log() expressions with Math.log10() for base-10 logarithms.</p>
<h4>Non-compliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
const result1 = Math.log(x) * Math.LOG10E; // Noncompliant
const result2 = Math.log(x) / Math.LN10; // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h4>Compliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
const result1 = Math.log10(x);
const result2 = Math.log10(x);
</pre>
