<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>There is no reason to re-assign a variable to itself. Either this statement is redundant and should be removed, or the re-assignment is a mistake
and some other value or variable was intended for the assignment instead.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
function setName(name) {
    name = name;
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
function setName(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
</pre>
