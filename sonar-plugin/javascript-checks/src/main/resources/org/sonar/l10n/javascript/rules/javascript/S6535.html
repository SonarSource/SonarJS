<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The <code>\</code> (backslash) character indicates that the next character should be treated as a literal character rather than as a special
character or string delimiter. For instance, it is common to escape single quotes inside a string literal using the single quote delimiter like
<code>'It\'s a beautiful day'</code>. Escaping is only meaningful for special characters. Escaping non-special characters in strings, template
literals, and regular expressions doesnâ€™t affect their value.</p>
<pre>
const regex = /[\[]/;  // Noncompliant: '[' does not need to be escaped when inside a character class '[]'
const octal = '\8';    // Noncompliant: '8' is not valid octal number
const hello = 'Hello, world\!';    // Noncompliant: '!' is not a special character
const path  = `\/${some}\/${dir}`; // Noncompliant: '/' is not a special character
</pre>
<p>Therefore, useless escapes impact code readability and could even denote a bug in the code if the developer left it by mistake or intended to
escape another special character instead.</p>
<p>You should check if the escape character was not misplaced. Useless character escapes can safely be removed without changing the original
value.</p>
<pre>
const regex = /[[]/;
const octal = '8';
const hello = 'Hello, world!';
const path  = `/${some}/${dir}`;
</pre>
