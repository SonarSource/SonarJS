<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Public <code>static</code> fields in TypeScript should be declared as <code>readonly</code> to prevent them from being modified after their initial
assignment. This is a good practice because it makes the code safer by preventing accidental changes to these fields, which could lead to bugs that
are hard to detect and fix.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class MyClass {
    static myField = 42; // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<p>To fix this, declare you static field with the <code>readonly</code> qualifier .</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
class MyClass {
    static readonly myField = 42;
}
</pre>
