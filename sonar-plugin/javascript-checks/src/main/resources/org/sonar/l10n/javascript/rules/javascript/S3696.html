<p>It is a bad practice to <code>throw</code> something that’s not derived at some level from <code>Error</code>. If you can’t find an existing
<code>Error</code> type that suitably conveys what you need to convey, then you should extend <code>Error</code> to create one.</p>
<p>Specifically, part of the point of throwing <code>Error</code>s is to communicate about the conditions of the error, but literals have far less
ability to communicate meaningfully than <code>Error</code>s because they don’t include stacktraces.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
throw 404;                              // Noncompliant
throw "Invalid negative index.";        // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
throw new Error("Status: " + 404);
throw new Error("Invalid negative index.");{code}
</pre>
