<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The complexity of an expression is defined by the number of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> and <code>condition ? ifTrue : ifFalse</code>
operators it contains.</p>
<p>A single expression’s complexity should not become too high to keep the code readable.</p>
