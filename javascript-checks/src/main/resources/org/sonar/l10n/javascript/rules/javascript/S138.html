<p>
  A function that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities.</br>
  Such function inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.
</p>
<p>
  Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller functions which focus on well-defined tasks.
</p>
<p>
  Those smaller functions will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.
</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
  This function ignores Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), functions which are created and invoked without ever being assigned a name.
</p>
<pre>
 (function () { // Ignored by this rule

  function open() {  // Classic function declaration; not ignored
    // ...
  }

  function read() {
    // ...
  }

  function readlines() {
    // ...
  }
})();
</pre>
