<p>
  A function that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities.</br>
  Such functions inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.
</p>
<p>
  Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller functions which focus on well-defined tasks.
</p>
<p>
  Those smaller functions will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.
