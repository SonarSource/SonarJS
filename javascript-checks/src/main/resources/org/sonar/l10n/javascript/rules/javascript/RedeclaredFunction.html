<p>
This rule checks that functions declared in same scope don't have identical names.
Indeed, it is possible to declare 2 functions with the same name,
but only the last definition will be kept by the JavaScript engine before starting execution of the whole code.
</p>

<p>
The following code illustrates this:
</p>

<pre>
fun(); // prints "bar"

// first declaration of the function
function fun() {
  print("foo");
}

fun(); // prints "bar"

// redeclaration of the "fun" function: this definition overrides the previous one
function fun() {
  print("bar");
}

fun(); // prints "bar"
</pre>

<p>
This use of duplicate function name is often unwanted and can lead to bugs and more generally to confusing code.
