<p>Duplicated string literals make the process of refactoring error-prone, since you must be sure to update all occurrences.</p>
<p>On the other hand, constants can be referenced from many places, but only need to be updated in a single place.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>To prevent generating some false-positives, literals having less than 10 characters are excluded as well as literals matching <code>/^\w*$/</code>.
String literals inside import/export statements and JSX attributes are also ignored.</p>
