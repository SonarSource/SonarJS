<p>
Do not do this :
</p>

<pre>
var myString = 'A rather long string of English text, an error message \
                actually that just keeps going and going -- an error \
                message to make the Energizer bunny blush (right through \
                those Schwarzenegger shades)! Where was I? Oh yes, \
                you\'ve got an error and all the extraneous whitespace is \
                just gravy.  Have a nice day.';
</pre>

<p>
The whitespace at the beginning of each line can't be safely stripped at compile time;
whitespace after the slash will result in tricky errors;
and while most script engines support this, it is not part of ECMAScript.
</p>

<p>
Use string concatenation instead :
</p>

<pre>
var myString = 'A rather long string of English text, an error message ' +
    'actually that just keeps going and going -- an error ' +
    'message to make the Energizer bunny blush (right through ' +
    'those Schwarzenegger shades)! Where was I? Oh yes, ' +
    'you\'ve got an error and all the extraneous whitespace is ' +
    'just gravy.  Have a nice day.';
</pre>
