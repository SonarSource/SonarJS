<p>It is possible to use <code>await</code> on values which are not <code>Promise</code>s, but it's useless and misleading. The point of
<code>await</code> is to pause execution until the <code>Promise</code>'s asynchronous code has run to completion. With anything other than a
<code>Promise</code>, there's nothing to wait for.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when an <code>await</code>ed value is guaranteed not to be a <code>Promise</code>.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
let x = 42;
await x; // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
let x = new Promise(resolve =&gt; resolve(42));
await x;

let y = p ? 42 : new Promise(resolve =&gt; resolve(42));
await y;
</pre>
