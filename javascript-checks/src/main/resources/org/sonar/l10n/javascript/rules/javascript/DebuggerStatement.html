<p>
The debugger statement can be placed anywhere in procedures to suspend execution.
Using the debugger statement is similar to setting a breakpoint in the code.
By definition such statement must absolutely be removed from the source code to prevent any unexpected behavior in production.

<p>Here is an example of JavaScript code :</p>

<pre>
for (i = 1; i<5; i++) {
  // Print i to the Output window.
  Debug.write("loop index is " + i);
  // Wait for user to resume.
  debugger;
}
</pre>
