<p>JavaScript does not have an integer type, but it does have bitwise operators <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>. These operators convert their operands from floating point values to integers and back, so they are not as efficient as in C or other languages. Further, they are rarely useful in browser applications, and the similarity to the logical operators can mask some programming errors.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

<pre>
if (a &amp; b) { ... } // Noncompliant; &amp; used in error
var oppositeSigns = ((x ^ y) &lt; 0); // Noncompliant; there's a clearer way to test for this
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>

<pre>
if (a &amp;&amp; b) { ... }
var oppositeSigns = false;
if ( (x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &gt; 0) || (x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0) ) {
  oppositeSigns = true;
}
</pre>
