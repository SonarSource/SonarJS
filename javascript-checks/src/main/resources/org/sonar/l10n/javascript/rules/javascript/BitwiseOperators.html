<p>
JavaScript does not have an integer type, but it does have bitwise operators << >> >>> ~ & | ^.
The bitwise operators convert their operands from floating point to integers and back, so they are not as efficient as in C or other languages.
They are rarely useful in browser applications.
The similarity to the logical operators can mask some programming errors.
