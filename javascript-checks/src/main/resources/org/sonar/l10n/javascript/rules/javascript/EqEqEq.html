<p>
The == and != operators do type coercion before comparing.
This is bad because it causes ' \t\r\n' == 0 to be true.
This can mask type errors.
It is best to not use == and != and to always use the more reliable === and !== operators instead.

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
Even if testing the equality of a variable against null doesn't do exactly what most JavaScript developers believe, usage of == or != is tolerated in such context. In the following case, if foo hasn't been initialized, its default value is not null but undefined. Nevertheless undefined == null, so JavaScript developers get the expected behavior.
</p>
<pre>
if(foo == null) {...}
</pre>
