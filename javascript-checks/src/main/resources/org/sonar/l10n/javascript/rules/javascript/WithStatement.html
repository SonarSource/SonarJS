<p>
The object of the with can have properties that collide with local variables, it can drastically change the meaning of your program :
</p>

<pre>
with (foo) {
  var x = 3;
  return x;
}
</pre>

<p>
The local variable x could be clobbered by a property of foo and perhaps it even has a setter, in which case assigning 3 could cause lots of other code to execute.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, 'with' statement should never be used. Instead, the previous code should be refactored to make direct calls to the object (<code>foo.x</code> in the previous example).
</p>

<p>
What's more, using the 'with' statement would produce an error in JavaScript strict mode code.
