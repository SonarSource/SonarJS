<p>Just because you <em>can</em> stick your hand in a blender, that doesn't mean you <em>should</em>. Similarly, you <em>can</em> <code>throw</code>
anything, but that doesn't mean you <em>should</em> <code>throw</code> something that's not derived at some level from
<code>std::exception</code>.</p>
<p>If you can't find an existing exception type that suitably conveys what you need to convey, then you should extend <code>std::exception</code> to
create one.</p>
<p>Specifically, part of the point of throwing exceptions is to communicate about the conditions of the error, but primitives have far less ability to
communicate meaningfully than <code>exception</code>s. And, the creation of some other object type could itself <code>throw</code> an exception,
resulting in program termination.</p>
<p>Further, <code>catch</code>ing non-exception types is painful and fraught with the potential for (further) error.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
throw 42;                               // Noncompliant
throw "Invalid negative index.";        // Noncompliant
throw std::string("Permission denied"); // Noncompliant
throw nullptr;                          // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
throw std::domain_error("User ID not found.");
throw std::out_of_range("Invalid negative index.");
throw std::system_error(EACCES, std::system_category());
throw std::invalid_argument("Unexpected null 'user_id' argument.");
</pre>
