<p>Dependencies should be explicitly listed in the <code>package.json</code> file. Importing a module that is not declared as a dependency makes it an
implicit one and is bound to create problems. For example, a code might depend on a module that is present in <code>node_modules</code> as a
transitive dependency; this dependency could be updated or removed without you noticing that, which could make your code fail.</p>
