Even if it can be considered as a good practice to enforce JavaScript strict mode, this may result in unexpected behaviours on browsers that do not support it yet.
Using this feature should consequently be done with caution and with full knowledge of the potential consequences on browsers that do not support it.

The following code snippet illustrates the use of strict mode:
</p>

<pre>
function strict() {
  'use strict';
}
</pre>
