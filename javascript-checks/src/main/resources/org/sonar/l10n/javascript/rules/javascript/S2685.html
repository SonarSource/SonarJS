<p>
  Both <code>arguments.caller</code> and <code>arguments.callee</code> make quite a few optimizations impossible so they were deprecated in latest versions of JavaScript. In fact, EcmaScript 5 forbids the use of both in <code>strict</code> mode, according to the docs:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Arguments objects for strict mode functions define non-configurable accessor properties named "caller" and "callee" which throw a TypeError exception on access.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The same restriction applies to the function's <code>caller</code> and <code>arguments</code> properties in <code>strict</code> mode.
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
function whoCalled() {
   if (arguments.caller == null)   //Noncompliant
      console.log('I was called from the global scope.');
   else
      console.log(arguments.caller + ' called me!');

      console.log(whoCalled.caller);  // Noncompliant
      console.log(whoCalled.arguments);  // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
