<p>ECMAScript 2015 added the ability to use template literals instead of concatenation. Since their use is clearer and more concise, they are
preferred in environments that support ECMAScript 2015.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a string is created from the result of two or more concatenations.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log("hello " + name);  // ignored
}

function madLib(verb, noun) {
  console.log("I really " + verb + " one or two " + noun);  // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`hello ${name}`);  // no issue raised before, but this is better
}

function madLib(verb, noun) {
  console.log(`I really ${verb} one or two ${noun}`);
}
</pre>
