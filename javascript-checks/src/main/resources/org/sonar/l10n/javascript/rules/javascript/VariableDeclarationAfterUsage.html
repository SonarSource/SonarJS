<p>One of the biggest sources of confusion for JavaScript beginners is scoping. The reason scoping is so confusing in JavaScript is because JavaScript looks like a C-family language but doesn't act like one. C-family languages have block-level scope, meaning that when control enters a block, such as an <code>if</code> statement, new variables can be declared within that scope without affecting the outer scope. However, this is not the case in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To minimize confusion as much as possible, variables should always be declared before they are used.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

<pre>
var x = 1;

function fun(){
  alert(x); // Noncompliant as x is declared later in the same scope
  if(something) {
    var x = 42; // Declaration in function scope (not block scope!) shadows global variable
  }
}

fun(); // Unexpectedly alerts "undefined" instead of "1"
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>

<pre>
var x = 1;

function fun() {
  print(x);
  if (something) {
    x = 42;
  }
}

fun(); // Print "1"
</pre>
